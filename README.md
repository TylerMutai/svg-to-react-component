**SVGToReactComponent** is a practical, user-friendly web tool that effortlessly takes your SVGs and outputs ready to
use, customizable React components. This potent tool is aimed at simplifying your SVG handling in React, enabling the
SVG components to adapt to dynamic environment changes just like any other React component.

  ready-to-use React components.

  SVGs' inflexibility.
- **Flexibility**: The generated React components allow you to directly manipulate the SVGs within your JSX code.

  making them as flexible and React-friendly as ever.

## How To Use

1. **Upload SVGs**: Click the **'Select SVG files'** button to choose SVG files from your device.

   convenient zip file.
4. **Implement**: Extract the zip file and integrate them into your project in your preferred way. Be it in a button, a
   div, or an anchor element, they'll adopt the properties of their parent element.
